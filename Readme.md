# Student Projects

Hi Everyone !
This repo is just a place where I stock all my projects from UPMC. You're welcome to use what you want, if you want !
Code is open source, under MIT License. Just precise it comes from me ! (And a little thank or a star, for such a beautiful code is, of course, awesome ! ðŸ˜‰)

## Tree hierarchy
Each root folder correspond to one course. You'll find, in each folder, a subfolder by project, if needed.
We ([DadaIsCrazy](https://github.com/DadaIsCrazy) and me) sometimes wrote two different versions for the same project. It can be in different folder (one by language), or mixed in the same place.
Nearly every project is working.

Enjoy !
